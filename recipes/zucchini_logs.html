    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My friend's wife served zucchini logs as a dinner side, and I was blown away! It's a simple recipe, but it's delicious. I can't take full credit for this one--feel free to steal it yourself!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 zucchini</li>
        <li>1 pack of dry vegetable soup mix</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>slice the zucchini in half lengthwise</li>    
        <li>use a teaspoon to scoop the seeds out of the center, creating a dish-like cavity</li>    
        <li>blend the cream cheese, shredded cheese, and soup mix</li>    
        <li>spoon the cheese mixture into the cavity of each zucchini half</li>    
        <li>bake on a tray for 20 minutes at 350 degrees</li>    
    </ol>
